# Building a WeeWar Hex Map Extractor: A Technical Journey

WeeWar is a turn-based strategy game with hexagonal tile maps. Each map consists of different terrain types (grass, water, mountains, etc.) arranged in a hex grid.  I have been a huge fan of this game since its early days - going as far as to build a simple but sadly incomplete Flash (yep) based version of it.  But I gave up because having to recreate assets was not my fun time activity.

But have you ever tried to reverse-engineer a game map from a single image? Not the kind of problem you'd expect to keep you up at night, but that's exactly what happened when I decided to extract WeeWar map layouts from their preview images.

## The Deceptively Simple Problem

While one of my (Claude) sessions was doing its thing on a terminal, this game again came up on my mind and I thought well instead of rebuilding the game why not take up the boring activity I had eschewed all those years ago?  The challenge seemed straightforward: given only a preview image of a map, extract the individual hex tiles and determine their positions automatically.  Here's an amazing 

*How hard could it be?* Famous last words.

The requirements were deceptively simple but technically demanding:
- Work with any scale of image (the system shouldn't depend on hardcoded tile sizes)
- Detect the hex grid structure from visual boundaries
- Extract individual tiles without neighbor contamination
- Handle the tiles typically found in a XxY WeeWar map (large maps could have over 30 rows and/or columns)


This is the "AI Era".  So my first instinct was to throw this to Claude (cli).  Here was my first attempt:

```
You have the images of tiles/terrain in the folder ./AllTiles .   Each tile is numbered so the images will be called <tileType>.png and represents a particular kind of terrain (eg grass, sea, dessert etc).  Some tiles will have color variations (denoting which player has occupied the tile - eg a building belonging to player 3).

Select the image "./map.png".  It contains hexagonal tiles with each tile mapping to one of the tiles in the ./AllTiles
folder.  I want you to extract each of the tiles the image and save it as R_C_T_P.png where R is the row number, C is the
column and T is the tileType and P is which player has occupied the tile.  If the tile is a neutral color then you can
set P=x (to denote a neutral terrain).
```

Here's the test map btw:


![Our Test Map](https://github.com/panyam/weemaps/blob/main/map.png?raw=true)

So at this point LLMs are smart enough to know they cant tackle it all so it proposed to create a script to do just that:

```
⏺ I'll help you extract individual tiles from the map image and save them with the specified naming convention. Let me start by examining the structure and
  creating a plan.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Examine the map.png image to understand the hexagonal tile layout
     ☐ List all tile types in the AllTiles folder to understand available terrain types
     ☐ Create a Python script to extract hexagonal tiles from the map image
     ☐ Implement tile type identification by comparing extracted tiles to reference tiles
     ☐ Implement player identification based on color variations
     ☐ Save extracted tiles with R_C_T_P.png naming convention
```

Now whether at this point whether you thought Claude was going to crush or that it was going to spectacularly fail you both would be forgiven.  LLMs are at this crazy place right now but it is best not to always succumb to the vibe-coding (VC) hype despite what the VCs tell you!   And ofcourse I had an alternative flow for this blog regardless of how the LLM fared!

Ok so when I ran the [python script](https://github.com/panyam/weemaps/blob/main/tile_extractor.py) it confidently gave me a bunch of images. I was really rooting for it.  But examining it files looked like this.  Not really off to a great start (i guess it *did* produce a great looking script that actually ran without errors):

Now you cant just give up on LLMs on the first try.  I tried one more thing:

```
> Ok that did not quite work.  You seem to have segemented the image in rectangular blocks instead of along the hexagonal tile boundaries.   
```

Which resulted in [hex_tile_extractor.py](https://github.com/panyam/weemaps/blob/main/tile_extractor.py) ...

... Which was not actually bad.  We now saw the following grid summary:


```

...
...

Row 5, Col 2: Tile 8 (confidence: 1.0000)

Tile Array (2D):
Row 0: [8, 14, 5, 5, 4, 8, 8, 8]
Row 1: [5, 5, 5, 5, 14, 14, 15, 8]
Row 2: [3, 23, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 10]
Row 3: [10, 2, 5, 5, 5, 8, 5, 4]
Row 4: [8, 15, 14, 4, 8, 5, 5, 8]
Row 5: [8, 8, 8, 4, 5, 5, 4, 8]
```

Our [test image](https://github.com/panyam/weemaps/blob/main/maps.png) - Actually was a 7x7 hexagonal grid.  AND here's a funny thing about hex-grids - An x-coordinate actually "shifts" in position depending on whether it is on an odd numbered row or an even numbered row (il let you try to imagine this).

Definitely some progress to this.  My gut is asking me to give up, but I need to try one more thing (I do have to 
squeeze every token out of my pro plan!)

```
> Ok you returned a rectangular of 6 rows by 7 columns.  However the image has 7 rows by 7 columns.  
  Second problem is in the image some sections wont have any tiles.  
  There id like your classifier to return a "0" - those represent "holes" in maps.   
  The third thing Id like you to do is to think about Hex tiles are laid out.  They are not in a rectangular grid.  
  The "x" position of the first tile in odd-number rows are always half-tile-width greater than the even-numbered rows.  
  
  Think about how to represent this.
```

Ok so now we have the third type of classifier.  The all-hailing [Hex Map Classifier](https://github.com/panyam/weemaps/blob/main/hex_map_classifier.py) which hard coded the number of rows and columns to 7.  Dow.  Ok another quick scolding gave us the even better dynamic version - [Dynamic Hex Map Classifier](https://github.com/panyam/weemaps/blob/main/dynamic_hex_map_classifier.py):

```
> You are hardcoding the number of rows and columns.   You should not be!
```

Ok certainly looks promising:

```
...
...

Row 5, Col 1: No good match (confidence: 1.0000)
Row 5, Col 2: No good match (confidence: 0.8929)
Row 5, Col 3: Tile 4 (confidence: 0.6809)
Row 5, Col 4: Tile 5 (confidence: 0.1701)
Row 5, Col 5: Tile 5 (confidence: 0.0789)
Row 5, Col 6: Tile 4 (confidence: 0.5907)
Row 5, Col 7: No good match (confidence: 1.0000)
Classification complete! Results saved to dynamic_hex_classification.json
Grid size: 6 rows x 9 columns

Dynamic Hexagonal Map Array (0s for holes):
Row 0: [0, 14, 5, 5, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Row 1: [5, 5, 5, 5, 14, 14, 15, 0, 0]
Row 2: [4, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 14, 10, 0]
Row 3: [10, 23, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 14, 0]
Row 4: [0, 15, 14, 4, 8, 5, 5, 5, 4]
Row 5: [0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0]

Visual representation (0 = hole, numbers = tile types):
Row 0:  0 14  5  5  7  0  0  0  0
Row 1:    5  5  5  5 14 14 15  0  0
Row 2:  4  5  5  5  0  5 14 10  0
Row 3:   10 23  5  0  5  5  5 14  0
Row 4:  0 15 14  4  8  5  5  5  4
Row 5:    0  0  0  4  5  5  4  0  0
```

But this is going to get hard to debug.  Let us whip up a visualizer too:

```
> Great.  Ok let us create a visualizer (in python) tool that can represent the output of the classified tile array as an svg hex map using the
  AllTiles/<tileNumber>.svg.  The output should a html page with a .svg showing in it alongside the original image (map.png).
```

Result: [Hex Map Visualizer](https://github.com/panyam/weemaps/blob/main/hex_map_visualizer.py)

A picture is worth a 1000 words.  Or rather is great for invalidating a 1000 classifier results!   Sadly while our tile
table looked fancy, the visualizer showed a different picture.

## Try Hashing

At this point my patience was wearing thin but my OCD wasnt let me give up.   Me explaining to the LLM in english was painful (sorry but english is *not* a better programming language).   I wanted to try something more automatic.

In strings - especially large ones - performing bytewise comparisons are very slow so hashes can be used to test for equality.  Or rather they can be used for quick check to see if two strings are NOT equal.   If hashes are not equal, the underlying strings would NOT be equal.  However if two string hashes are "equal" then (and only then) would we need to check for full byte-by-byte comparisons.

We can do something in images.   However unlike text - we are interested in similarities rather than equal.   Images can be altered slightly (flipping a single pixel) with very little perceived difference to the human eye.  So what is needed is a fuzzy hash that can provide a fingerprint of an image that can be used to compare with another image.   This works well with signals in general were values are NON-DISCRETE values.   One such technique is the [Perceptual Hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_hashing).   

I wont go into the details of Perceptual Hashing (and the whole world of signal analysis - you should definitely check out [Fourier Transforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) and [Wavelet Transforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet_transform)).


As you can guess I wanted the LLM to use P-Hashing to test out the generated images (of the hex tiles) against the original map:

```
> Ok I need you compare what you are producing.  Use a p-hash mechanism to measure what you produced with the original image.
```

Result: [The Image Visualizer](https://github.com/panyam/weemaps/blob/main/image_comparison.py)

Here was a resultant diff between expected and produced images:

![Image Differences](/static/images/weemaps/03_difference_maps.png)

This was great but our accuracy had not increased.  I then realized that the tile rendering itself was broken.

```
> You have very low similarity. If you detected the right tiles AND generated the right shapes it would have been a lot more closer.  Also the structure
   is not current.   You are generating hex in the wrong "angle".   The tiles should be adjacent "left to right" with one side touching.  And sides would touch
  "diagonally".
```

This seemed to click something off.  It went on a frenzy generating an improved [classifer](https://github.com/panyam/weemaps/blob/main/correct_hex_classifier.py) and [rendering](https://github.com/panyam/weemaps/blob/main/correct_hex_generator.py).
Finally we are seeing a decent generated image based on the new weights:

```
$ python correct_hex_classifier.py
...

Row 3: [10, 8, 5, 5, 8, 10, 0]

```

And to generate the image:

```
$ python correct_hex_generator.py
```
