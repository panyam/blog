I had three terminal windows open, each running a perfectly functional instance of [Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air). My Go services were hot-reloading beautifully, each in their own little world. Air was doing exactly what it promised - and doing it well. But as I alt-tabbed between terminals, trying to spot which service just logged that error, I realized I needed something different. Not better. Different.

What started as a simple terminal organization tool evolved into something more interesting: a nice bridge between traditional development workflows and AI Coding Agents. But I'm getting ahead of myself...

This is the story of why and how I built devloop, a multi-project watcher and orchestrator.


## Five Terminals Is Four Too Many

Let me be clear upfront: Air is fantastic. I use it every day. If you're working on a single Go project, it's pretty much perfect. The same goes for nodemon in the Node.js world, or watchexec as a language-agnostic option. These tools have solved the live-reloading problem elegantly.

But here's where my use case diverged. I was working on my goto setup:
- A Go API backend
- Another Go service for background jobs  
- A React frontend with its own build process (and a htmx FE for another project)
- Documentation bundles that needed rebuilding
- The odd database migration to be run when (SQL) schemas changed.

Each of these had their own watch-and-rebuild needs. I could run five different tools in five different terminals, but the cognitive overhead was killing me. When an error occurred, I had to:
1. Figure out which terminal it came from
2. Scroll back through interleaved logs
3. Try to piece together the timeline of what happened

I needed an orchestrator. Something that could conduct these setups of tools while letting each run on their own independently. And maybe, just maybe, something that could expose all this activity to the AI assistants that were increasingly becoming part of my development flow.

Before going into why I built devloop, let us look at the alternatives, aka ....

## By why not just ...

### ... Run each specific tool as a background daemon, pipe it all to a file and then tail all the files in a combined way?

ie here you would so something like:

```
npm run dev 2>&1 | tee npm.log
```

```
air 2>&1 | tee backend.log
```

and so on, and finally tail them together:

```
tail -f npm.log backend.log ..... 
```

Well you *could* if that is your jam and find that ergonomic enough.   First of all if any of the dev servers (npm or air) failed then you are out of luck.  

### ... GNU Make with parallel execution?

Following from above something like `make -j5 run-all` could theoretically run all your services. But Make wasn't designed for long-running processes. It's a build tool, not a process manager. Kill one service and Make gets confused. Plus, interleaved output becomes unreadable without prefixing.

### ... write a shell script?


eg:

```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  npm run dev &
  air &
  ./worker &
  wait
```

This is doable - until you need to restart just one service. Or see which one failed. Or grep logs. Or handle signals properly. Shell scripts grow complexity like entropy - always increasing, never decreasing.

### ... VS Code multi-task runner?

VS Code's task runner can run multiple tasks. But it's tied to VS Code, outputs to separate terminals, and isn't easily scriptable (definitely would love to learn more about this). What happens when you ssh into your dev box? Or when your AI assistant needs to check build status?

### ... create systemd user services?

You could write systemd unit files for each service. But now you're managing systemd configs for local development, dealing with journalctl for logs, and explaining to your macOS colleagues why it doesn't work on their machine.

### ... Use tmux with synchronized panes?

Tmux is great for managing multiple terminal sessions. You could split your terminal into panes and run each service. But you're still manually managing each process, logs are still separated, and you lose them when tmux crashes. Plus, good luck getting your AI assistant to read from tmux panes.

### ... Bundle your services in a docker-compose environment?

(or if you are adventurous in a minikube environment)?

This is an excellent option if you want production level isolation and orchestration, but they come at a cost:

  1. Startup overhead - Containers take time to build and start. When you're iterating, you want millisecond restarts, not 30-second container rebuilds
  2. Debugging friction - Attaching debuggers, accessing logs, and using local dev tools is more complex through container layers
  3. File sync lag - Volume mounting can be slow (especially on macOS), adding latency to the edit-reload cycle
  4. Resource consumption - Running 5+ containers locally can eat up RAM and CPU
  5. Different needs - Local dev often needs different configs, environment variables, and tools than production
  6. Simplicity - You're trying to reduce complexity, not add orchestration layers.  Also with multi component builds you are still producing a single binary (or few binaries).   For example if one of your continuous trigger targets is documentation - containers are not exactly the cleanest choice for that.

I love docker (and have often docker-compose environments where multiple microservices were invovlved.   But spinning up five containers just to develop locally felt like wearing a tuxedo to write code in my pajamas. The overhead - build times, volume mounting on Mac, RAM consumption - was getting in the way of the thing I actually wanted to do: write code and see it run. Fast.

## Learning from the Best

Before writing a single line of code, I spent time understanding the problems these tools solved. Air showed me what developers loved about live-reloading. Nodemon demonstrated the value of clear process management. Watchexec proved that language-agnostic tools have their place. More then their code, their users and use cases were fascinating.

The initial prototype was almost embarrassingly simple:

```go
// First attempt: just wrap multiple commands
type Rule struct {
    Name     string
    Patterns []string
    Command  string
}
```

But this simplicity forced me to think about the real problem. Just watching files isnt exciting nor did it add value - fsnotify had solved that. Same with "just" running commands - os/exec was mature.  My instinct was pointing towards orchestration, coordination, and presentation.

## The Two-Day Sprint

Here's something I haven't mentioned yet: I built the entire first version of devloop in two days.  And I did it by pair programming with Claude and Gemini in what I can only describe as the most intense flow state I've ever experienced.    Let's be honest.  I think we are at point in time where keeping your AI usage secret is just ... well ... silly.  

I'm not talking about copying and pasting from &lt;your-favorite-llm&gt;. I'm talking about using AI as a true programming partner - bouncing ideas, iterating on designs, and yes, generating code. But here's the key: I maintained complete ownership of the architecture and code quality. The AI was my accelerator, not my autopilot.  At points being able to identify wrong decisions the agents were making, interrupting them (in their "auto-accept" state) saved me a lot mess down the road.

Every line of code went through my filter. Every design decision was mine. But instead of spending hours on boilerplate or searching through documentation, I could focus on the interesting problems. When I needed a process group implementation, I could discuss trade-offs with AI and get a working implementation in minutes instead of hours.

The result? Clean, maintainable code that I understand completely - just delivered at 10x speed.

And here's where things got meta. As I was building devloop with AI, I kept thinking: "What if the AI could actually see what's happening with my builds?  What if it could read the logs, understand the errors, and help fix them while the changes were triggering live builds?" This planted the seed for what would become the MCP integration.

By the way of a tangent - there are a lot of interesting insights about where they shined and where they *whined*, TL;DR - Gemini got me 80% there and then just started spinning creating more and more mess.  Brought Claude in to fix all the messy loops Gemini was getting itself into.

## The Architecture Evolution

The journey from wrapper to orchestrator happened in stages. First came the realization that I needed proper process management. Killing a web server cleanly is different from killing a build process. Process groups became my friend.

![Architecture Evolution](/static/images/devloop/architecture-evolution.svg)

Then came the logging challenge. When you have five services outputting logs simultaneously, you need more than just timestamps. The prefix system was born:

```go
[backend]  Starting server on :8080
[frontend] Webpack build completed
[worker]   Processing job: send-emails
[backend]  GET /api/users 200 OK
```

This seems obvious in retrospect, but getting the buffering right so that multi-line outputs stayed together took more attempts than I'd like to admit.

## Technical Decisions and Trade-offs

### Why YAML Over TOML?

Air uses TOML, and it works great. But when I looked at my use cases, YAML made more sense:
- Better support for lists and nested structures
- More familiar to the Kubernetes/Docker Compose generation
- Easier to express complex watch patterns

Dont get me wrong.  TOML is not inferior, YAML just suited my purposes better.  Frankly at some point I'll just enable the configs to be written in any format and they can be loaded just as easily.

### The Great Glob(sby)

One of my favorite bugs came from glob pattern matching. The initial implementation used [gobwas/glob](https://github.com/gobwas/glob), which is blazing fast. But it interpreted `**` differently than most developers expected. 

When someone writes `src/**/*.go`, they expect it to match both `src/main.go` and `src/pkg/util/helper.go`. However the `gobwas/glob` implmentation only allowed `1 or more` subdirectory matches instead of the `0 or more` expected by convention - eg .gitignore files.   So here I switched to using the [bmatcuk/doublestar](https://github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar) library.   The way around this would have been to rewrite `src/**/*.go` to `src/{*.go,**/*.go}` but it was just getting more complex and "magical" without explanation. 

### Process Management: Lessons from the Trenches

The hardest part wasn't starting processes - it was stopping them cleanly. Different platforms handle process groups differently. A web server needs graceful shutdown. A build process might spawn its own children.  Process management is a common challenge in tools like this. Here's the solution I arrived at:

```go
// Create a new process group
cmd.SysProcAttr = &syscall.SysProcAttr{
    Setpgid: true,
}

// Later, signal the entire group
syscall.Kill(-pgid, syscall.SIGTERM)
```

## The Distributed Twist

I hit another wall. I was working on a microservices project where services were spread across multiple repositories. Running devloop in each directory worked, but I was back to multiple terminals.

This sparked the agent/gateway architecture:

![Agent Gateway Architecture](/static/images/devloop/agent-gateway-flow.svg)

The gateway became a central hub, with agents connecting from each project. Now I had:
- One place to see all logs
- Unified API for monitoring
- Ability to trigger builds across projects

This had the immediate benefit of enabling "unified logging" and exposing the various watchers to MCP clients via an MCP server running on the gateway!

Goal here was definitely not to create another N+1 tool.   This was more about decoupling the "management" experience from the actual work.   And in the process this was about improving the development experience.

(By the way here was one of the times where the AI went off the rails trying to propose a Server running on the agent the Gateway would ping and query.  I had to correct it as it would have led to a ton of complexity and not to mention network and firewall hell).

## Embracing the Future: MCP and AI Assistants

The latest evolution came from a "what if" moment. What if my AI coding assistant could not just write code, but also run it, see the errors, and iterate? What if it could monitor builds across my entire stack?

In one way -tThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration improves developer "bandwidth" reducing the need for context swtiches. Imagine telling your AI assistant: "The API is failing tests, can you check the logs and suggest a fix?" And it can actually do it.

## Challenges and Reality Checks

Let's talk about what didn't work:

**Race Conditions**: Sometimes a file save triggers multiple events. Sometimes events arrive out of order. Debouncing is great for performance and "eventual" correctness.

**Cross-Platform Pain**: What works on macOS might not work on Linux. Windows has its own special requirements. Process management, in particular, is a minefield.

**The Streaming Problem**: Streaming logs from multiple sources through gRPC to HTTP clients while maintaining order and not dropping messages... let's just say distributed systems and threading challenges are like snowflakes.  Very seldom are two of them alike.

## Standing on Shoulders

None of this would have been possible without the incredible [Go](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/) ecosystem:
- [fsnotify](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify) for file watching
- gRPC and [grpc-gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway) for APIs
- The countless examples and patterns from tools like Air, nodemon, and watchexec

I owe a particular debt to [Rick/cosmtrek](https://github.com/cosmtrek), the creator of Air for setting an amazing benchmark on both simplicity and robustness one can expect from a tool like this.

## Where We Are Now

Devloop is now at a point where it's stable and useful. It's running in my daily development workflow, orchestrating services, and making life a bit easier. The agent/gateway architecture is working well for distributed setups. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration is opening new possibilities.

But it's not perfect. Windows support could be better. The configuration syntax could be more intuitive. Performance with very large numbers of files needs to be observed and improved.

And that's okay. Tools evolve. They grow with their use cases.

## Try It Out

If you're juggling multiple services in development, give devloop a try. It might not be the right fit for everyone - if you're happy with your current setup, stick with it! But if you find yourself drowning in terminals or wishing for a unified view of your development stack, it might help.

```bash
go install github.com/panyam/devloop@latest
```

Start simple with a `.devloop.yaml`:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: "backend"
    watch:
      - action: "include"
        patterns: ["**/*.go"]
    commands:
      - "go build -o bin/api ./cmd/api"
      - "./bin/api"
```

The repository is at [github.com/panyam/devloop](https://github.com/panyam/devloop). Issues, PRs, and feedback are welcome. 

## Looking Forward

The future of development tooling is collaborative - not just between humans, but between humans and AI. Tools like devloop are bridges, connecting our traditional workflows with new possibilities.

I'm excited to see where the community takes this. Maybe someone will build a GUI on top. Maybe the MCP integration will enable workflows I haven't imagined. Maybe someone will fork it and create something even better.

That's the beauty of open source. We build on each other's work, each solving our own problems and sharing the solutions.

Happy coding, and may your builds be ever swift and your logs forever organized.

*PS: If you're using Air, nodemon, or watchexec and they're working great for you - keep using them! The best tool is the one that solves your problem. Devloop just solves a different problem.*
