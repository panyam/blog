Until now this site has been powered by NextJS.   Rewinding back a little more, for the last 10 years, I have been on the search for the perfect blog hosting solution.   

1. Wordpress - one of my first trials was to put content on wordpress.  It had its benefits (pros and cons)
2. Simple wordpress like hosting on a personal domain - again pros and cons
3. Just host a bunch of static html pages on app engine
4. Use a static site generator like hugo and finally settled on NextJS.

I had taken a temporary break from blogging about a year ago.   Then I tried to put something out there recently only to find that the NextJS eco-system *really* sucks.
May be also talk about notations.us - and how i moved that out of Next -> go/htmx

But I did not want to *just* go to back to Hugo.  Oh by the way - if you just want a static site - definitely check out Hugo - it is phenomenal.

But if you want to build a webapp - but *also* serve a content-ful static site *along* with it where you want to use your own conventions and not depending others - then read on.   We will build a static site generator where you get to mix and match YOUR conventions for YOUR site.  It really is not as hard as I have discovered.

The proof is in the pudding.  Every post you see after this one is powered by the new site.  here are old pics and the new ones:

SIDE BY SIDE pics of the site.

V1 - easiest s3 - no gen - just do everything in html
V2 - Walk through all html files in contnet root and render them to their output_dir equivalent
V3 - Create MD/MDX files instead of html and remove "common" elements

Issues:
1. URL Mappings
2. Languages/Locales
3. Themes and Layouts 
4. Global assets
5. Data files?
6. Template inheritance and Composition - here is where our "View" objects come in?
7.
