### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My day jobs include Software Engineering, Engineering Management, Technical Leadership and more details are in my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/srirampanyam).  I am currently the Chief Architect and Founding Engineer at [Omlet Inc](https://omlet.co) - an observability startup based out of the bay area.

### Personal Blog

My personal blog is [BuildMage](https://buildmage.com).  I love writing about large scale System Design, Algorithms, My current passion projects, Carnatic music and more.  Would love to hear more about it.

### Interests

My interests are in programming languages (PL), distributed systems, building control planes and a bunch of things.  Some of my special projects are:

[Notations](https://github.com/panyam/notations) -  A carnatic music notationing, editing and renderling library.  It is currently live at [Notations.us](https://notations.us).

[TLEX](https://github.com/panyam/tlex)/[GALORE](https://github.com/panyam/galore) - As a PL enthusiast I wanted to build my own versions of Flex and Yacc in typescript from the ground up and incorporate all things state of the art!   Who knows one day may even touch the base camp of the Everest that is [Treesitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/)!

[OneHub](https://github.com/panyam/onehub) - A basic Kitchen Sink kind of chat app for testing different things from distributed log replication to message integrations to building modern go webservices and more.
