## Problem

Implement the following methods, which convert (signed) integers to a string and vice versa respectively:

```
intToString x :: Int -> [Char]

stringToInt :: [Char] -> Int
```

Additionally invalid strings (when converting to Int) must return an error of some sort.



## Solution

Even though the question was specific to converting to and from base 10, this can be generalised to any base with *very* little changes.  The straightforward solution is:


```haskell showLineNumbers
intToString :: Int -> Int -> [Char]
intToString base x 
            | x < 0 = "-" ++ intToString base (-x)
            | x < base = [intToDigit x]
            | otherwise = (intToString base (div x base)) ++ [intToDigit (mod x base)]

stringToInt :: Int -> [Char] -> Int
stringToInt base (x:xs)
            | x == '-' = - (stringIntHelper base xs)
            | otherwise = stringIntHelper base (x:xs)
            where stringIntHelper base (x:xs)
                    | dx >= base = error ("Invalid digit: " ++ [x])
                    | length xs == 0 = digitToInt x
                    | otherwise = (dx * (floor (fromIntegral base ** fromIntegral digitsLeft))) + (stringIntHelper base xs)
                    where 
                        digitsLeft = (length xs)
                        dx = digitToInt x
```

Here is an alternative and more intuitive version of stringToIntHelper above:


```haskell showLineNumbers
stringToIntHelper2 base xs = 
            sum [ digit_to_value digit position |
                (position, digit) <- (zip dig_positions xs)]
    where 
        dig_positions = [(length xs) - 1, (length xs) - 2 .. 0]
        digit_to_value digit position = (digitToInt digit) * 
                            floor (base ** fromIntegral position)
```

This version does not check if each digit is between 0 and “base” but that is a trivial check to add via a “any” check in the original input (xs).
