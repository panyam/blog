## Problem

Continuing on from [EPI 5.6](/blog/epi/primitive-types/string-to-integer-conversion-functions/), this problem is to convert an integer encoded as S1 in base b1, to S2 in base b2:


## Solution

The easiest way is to use the techniques in EPI 5.6 and simply do:

```haskell showLineNumbers
base1ToBase2 b1 s1 b2 = intToString b2 (stringToInt b1 s1)
```

Anybody looking for a version without the intermediate conversion to base 10?
