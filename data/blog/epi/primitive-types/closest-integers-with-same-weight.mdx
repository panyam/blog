## Problem

The weight, W(x) of an integer, x, is the number of bits set (to 1) in binary.

Given a 64 bit unsigned integer x (where `W(x) != 0 and W(x) != 64`) find y such that `W(x) = W(y)` and `|x – y|` is minimized.

## Solution


An example would make this clear, eg if

X = 4 (dec) = 0100 (bin)

The candiates are:

0001   –   Diff = 3

0010   –   Diff = 2

1000   –   Diff = 4

So Y = 010 (bin) = 2 (dec).

The solution to this is to start with X and find the first “01” or “10” starting from the LEFT and then swap the bits.

In haskell this is (assuming a 64 bit number)

```haskell showLineNumbers
import Data.Bits
closest_neighbour_by_weight x = closest_neighbour_by_weight_aux x 0
    where closest_neighbour_by_weight_aux x i 
            | two_digits /= 0 && two_digits /= 3 = xor x (shiftL 3 i)
            | otherwise = closest_neighbour_by_weight_aux x (i + 1)
              where two_digits = (x `shiftR` i) .&. 3
```

Essentially starting from the least significant bit (i = 0), we see if the bit at position i and the bit at position i + 1 are the same. If they are same, then we recursively continue with i + 1. If they are NOT the same then the bits are swapped (with the `x ^ (3 << i)` in the False case) and that is the solution. The xor with 3 is just a easy way to swap two consecutive bits.
