## History

This site is *very* old.   It has taken a few interesting paths:

* It first started as a set of handbuilt html+js files (with inlined css) about 25 years ago - hosted on Geocities!



Outline:

* History
  Blog being very old, the tech choices we made, how our requirements changed,

* Latest was NextJS.  Served well but nextjs dependenceis started breaking in other projects (including Notation) and personally felt more complicated + bloat (talk about costs if we can and google more Nextjs problems) and how we also want to goto htmx

* NextJS was not a bad static site gen.   (point to tailwind starter).

* Then talk about why not build our own static site gen - after all it is just a bunch of html + css + templates built once and rendered for ever.  Theme around - instead of building client side pages that can *also* be server side (react) why not pure server side pages and then only use js as needed?
