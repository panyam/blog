[gRPC](https://grpc.io/) is a great framework for creating (micro) services in many environments.  gRPC offers a clean human readable source-of-truth of your service specs without needing further tools to understand them.    What makes the gRPC ecosystem shinte is its plugin facility for extending it on several fronts.   With plugins you can:

* Generate server stubs to implement your service logic
* Generate clients to talk to these servers
* Target several languages (golang, python, typescript etc) 
* Even targeting several transport types (http, tcp etc)

Here is an [awesome list](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/awesome-grpc) of curated plugins for the grpc ecosystem.   For example - you can even generate an http proxy gateway along with its own OpenAPI spec for those still needing them to consume your APIs by using the appropriate plugin.

This is Part 1 in the [gRPC Tutorial Series](/blog/grpc-series/) show casing best practises and tooling in building and deploying services using gRPC and Go.

This is not an advanced or a unique guide by any means.  Several tutorials exist out there serving this need (for bringing up a gRPC service with Go).  This guide walks through a simple service we are building from the ground up to serve as a foundation for the upcoming guides in this series.  With that disclaimer out of the way, let us get started.  

## Motivating Example

Let us build a simple service for a music site with the following entities:

* Songs - Composition of music that are performed by different artists.
* Artists - Performers who play/sing/perform songs for their loyal fans.
* Albums - A collection of songs performed by a bunch of artists.
* Labels - Record label companies who produce albums

(Kudos if you have noticed that the "User" is missing - we will come to all things about Auth, User management and even social features in a future article).

This service is simple enough but provides enough scope to take it in several directions which will be the topic of dedicated posts in the future.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have the following already installed:

* [golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) (1.18+)
* gRPC protoc tools for generating Go
  - `go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest`
  - `go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest`

**Optional** - We wont go too much into building services *outside* Go but just for fun we will also generate some of the Python stubs to show easy it all is and if there is popular demand one day there could be an extension to this series covering other languages in more detail.

* gRPC protoc tools for generating Python
  - `virtualenv env`
  - `source env/bin/activate`
  - `pip install grpcio`
  - `pip install grpcio-tools`

## Setup your project

Code for this can already be found in the [grpcdemos](https://github.com/panyam/grpcdemos/musicservice) repo.  The repo is organized by service and tags are used as checkpoints aligned with end of each part in this series for easier revisiting.

```
mkdir musicservice
cd musicservice
go mod init music.com/musicservice
mkdir -p protos/musicservice/v1
touch protos/musicservice/v1/models.proto
touch protos/musicservice/v1/labels.proto
touch protos/musicservice/v1/songs.proto
touch protos/musicservice/v1/albums.proto
touch protos/musicservice/v1/artists.proto

# Install dependencies
go get google.golang.org/grpc
```

Note when creating your protos it is good practise to have them versioned (v1 above).

There are several ways to organize your protos, for example (and not limited to):

1. One giant proto for the entire service encompassing all models and protos (eg musicservice.proto)
2. All Foo entity related models and services in foo.proto
3. All models in a single proto (models.proto) accompanied by services for entity Foo in foo.proto.

In this series we are using the 3rd approach as it also allows us to share models across service while still having clean and easy to absorb protos.

## Describe your Service

The .proto files are the starting point of a gRPC, so we can start there with some basic details:

```
embed models.proto here from github at the right tag
```

```
embed songs.proto here from github at the right tag
```

```
embed artists.proto here from github at the right tag
```

```
embed albums.proto here from github at the right tag
```

```
embed labels.proto here from github at the right tag
```

A few conventions to observe (without preaching any design practices):

* Entities (in models.proto) have an id field to denote their primary key/object ID
* All entities have a created/updated timestamp which are set in the create and update methods respectively.
* All services have the typical CRUD methods.
* The methods (rpcs) in each service follow similar patterns for their CRUD methods, eg:
  - `FooService.Get => method(GetFooRequest) => GetFooResponse`
  - `FooService.Delete => method(DeleteFooRequest) => DeleteFooResponse`
  - `FooService.Create => method(CreateFooRequest) => CreateFooResponse`
  - `FooService.Update => method(UpdateFooRequest) => UpdateFooResponse`
* FooServer.Create methods take a Foo instance and set the instances id, created_at and updated_at fields
* FooService.Update methods take a Foo instance along with a update_mask to highlight fields being changed and updates the fields.  Additionally it also ignores the id method so an id cannot be over-written.

Both Albums as well as Labels contain parent-child relationship (Album contains songs and artists) and Labels "own" Albums and use different representations appropriately.

Albums store artists and songs (as ids) in its record.  It is upto a front end to hydrate this list by making another call to fetch the artists and songs corresponding to the artist and song ids respectively.

In the case of Labels - the Albums are accessed via a List apis and Albums are added to/removed from a Label's ownership via respective Add/Remove methods.

## Generate the service stubs and clients

The `protoc` command-line tool ensures that server (stubs) and clients are generated from this basic stub.

The magic of protoc is that it does not generate anything on its own.  Instead it uses plugins for different "purposes" to generate custom artifacts.  First le tus generate go artifacts:

```
SRC_DIR=<ABSOLUTE_PATH_OF_MUSICSERVICE>
PROTO_DIR:=$SRC_DIR/protos
OUT_DIR:=$SRC_DIR/gen/musicservice/v1
protoc --go_out=$OUT_DIR --go_opt=paths=source_relative               \
       --go-grpc_out=$OUT_DIR --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative     \
       --proto_path=$PROTO_DIR/musicservice/v1/                       \
        $PROTO_DIR/musicservice/v1/*.proto
```

This is quite cumbersome so we can add this into a Makefile and simply run `make all` to generate protos and build everything going forward.

```
# Some vars to detemrine go locations etc
GOROOT=$(which go)
GOPATH=$(HOME)/go
GOBIN=$(GOPATH)/bin

# Evaluates the abs path of the directory where this Makefile resides
SRC_DIR:=$(shell dirname $(realpath $(firstword $(MAKEFILE_LIST))))

# Where the protos exist
PROTO_DIR:=$(SRC_DIR)/protos

# where we want to generate server stubs, clients etc
OUT_DIR:=$(SRC_DIR)/gen/go/musicservice/v1

all: printenv goprotos

goprotos:
	echo "Generating GO bindings"
	rm -Rf $(OUT_DIR) && mkdir -p $(OUT_DIR)
	protoc --go_out=$(OUT_DIR) --go_opt=paths=source_relative          	\
       --go-grpc_out=$(OUT_DIR) --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative		\
       --proto_path=$(PROTO_DIR)/musicservice/v1/ 											\
      $(PROTO_DIR)/musicservice/v1/*.proto

printenv:
	@echo MAKEFILE_LIST=$(MAKEFILE_LIST)
	@echo SRC_DIR=$(SRC_DIR)
	@echo PROTO_DIR=$(PROTO_DIR)
	@echo OUT_DIR=$(OUT_DIR)
	@echo GOROOT=$(GOROOT)
	@echo GOPATH=$(GOPATH)
	@echo GOBIN=$(GOBIN)
```

Now all generated stubs can be found in the `gen/go/musicservice/v1` folder.

Briefly the following are created:

* For every X.proto file a gen/go/musicservice/v1/X.pb.go is created.  This file contains the model definition of every "message" in the .proto file (eg Song, Label, CreateSongRequest, CreateSongResponse etc).
* For every Y.proto file that contains `service` definitions a X_grpc.pb.go file is generated that contains:
  - A server interface that must be implemented (coming in the next section).
  - For a service X, an interface called XService is generated where the methods are all the rpc methods stilated in the Y.proto file.
  - A client is generated that can talk to a running implementation of the XService interface (coming below).

Pretty powerful isnt it!  Now let us look at actually implementing the services.

## Implementing the Service

Our services are very simple.  They store the different instances in memory as a simple collection of elements added in the order in which they were created (we wont fiddle with databases for now) and serve them by querying and updating this collection.  Since all the services have (mostly) similiar implementations (CRUD) a base store object has been created to represent the in-memory collection and the services simply use this store.

The base entity store is:

```
Embed services/base.go here from the repo at the right tag
```

Using this the song service is very simple:

```
Embed services/songs.go here
```

Other models are also eerily similar to this and can be found in the repo.

## Wrap it all with a runner

We have implemented the services with our logic but the services need to be brought up.

The general steps are:

* create a GRPC Server instance
* register each our service implementations with this server
* run this server on a specific port

```
Embed cmd/server.go
```

This server can now be run (by default on port 9000) with:

```
go run cmd/server.go
```

## Call the server

Now it is time to test our server.  We shall make calls to this.  Note the grpc server is *not* a REST endpoint. So curl would not work (we will cover this in [Part 3](/blog/grpc-series/rest-http-gateway/)).  A grpc client ([grpc_cli](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/grpc)) exists to make direct calls from the command line.

On OSX, this can be installed with `brew install grpc`.

If the server is not running then go ahead and start it (as per the previous section).   We can now start calling operations on the server itself - either to make calls or reflect on it!
