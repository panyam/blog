As developers, few things are more comforting than the mighty command-line. For generated APIs (whether rpc or http) while generic CLIs can provide access (eg curl for a generated HTTP gateway) these still need a user to know (or atleast remember) the http semantics etc. A CLI exec/binary with simpler structure, some predefined conventions and more targeted documentation etc can significantly ease accessing the APIs from the command line. These can even be useful tools/artifacts to offer the consumers of your services.

Without further Ado let us dive into building a grpc plugin that generates one or more CLIs from custom annotations (defined in this tutorial) added to your protobuf definitions for your grpc services.

Note - this tutorial is **NOT** an in-depth tutorial for creating a grpc based service or creating http gateways for the grpc service. A simple enough service example will be provided that can highlight the various of nuances of building a plugin instead. Look at Part 1 for this.
