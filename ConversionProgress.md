We want to keep this file in a way so we can jot down quick notes so that when we actually write the blog it can look like we did this in steps.

So the way to do it is keep the following open:

1. Two side by side firefox windows - left window shows buildmage.com, right shows "current" blog during progress.
2. Tag of our code base at each "checkpoint" and in our static/public/images/gohtmx/TAG.png that shows what was the screenshot of the above two FF windows *at* that tag

At this point we could just go to the tag and see what the state of the repo was compared to "before" it (start is BEFORE_GOHTMX_MIGRATION) and describe then in our step by step blog

Or jot down her as we go (TAG as our headline from "so far we have this" kinda thing) - ie "push" things on top

GOHTMX_STEP1 - Create base project to show a serve a html page
